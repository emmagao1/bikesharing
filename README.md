# Bikesharing program analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of the NYC bikesharing analysis is to help the city Des Moines to decide if create a bike-sharing program is a good business idea. We performed detailed analyzation based on August bikesharing data as our starting point to determine how many rides we could expect in the city of Des Moines.
