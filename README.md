The purpose of the NYC bikesharing analysis is to help the city Des Moines to decide if create a bike-sharing program is a good business idea.

The analysis shows that most users are male and revenue is mostly generated from subscribers. In addition, the analysis showed most users utilize bike sharing program for commute as the popular rental hours are in the morning before work hours and in the evening after work hours.

We have gathered quite some useful information but in order to successfully launch the bike sharing program, we would need to know the popluation in the city of Des Moines as well as the weather during each season. The visualization of the population and the area of population concentration in Des Moines could help us to determine where to place the bikes for rental. Also, to understand the average temperature and rainfall during a year could help us to determine if the business is going to be sustainable.
