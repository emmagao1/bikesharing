# Bikesharing program analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of the NYC bikesharing analysis is to help the city Des Moines to decide if create a bike-sharing program is a good business idea. We performed detailed analyzation based on August bikesharing data as our starting point to determine how many rides we could expect in the city of Des Moines.

## Results
Our research focused on bike duration, bike duration by gender, popular bike rental times during weekdays and user types by gender during weekdays etc. Below are the graphs that's reflecting the research results.
